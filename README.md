Mix Backend Components

To be in-line with statement of transparency, we have made the decision to publicize our python code for our main post feed and feed when viewing a user or group's profile. 

We want to emphasize that the user has full control over amplifying and deamplifying content themselves through our interest based system. The main post feed aims to provide the user with posts based on the interests that they have chosen, giving each user power over what they want to see on their feed.
